# 🧠 Deep Learning Experiments – PyTorch & Keras

Welcome to my Deep Learning code repository! This repo serves as a collection of various deep learning models and experiments implemented using both **PyTorch** and **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repository includes:
- ✅ Implementation of CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, etc.
- ✅ Experiments on popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, IMDB, etc.
- ✅ Model training, evaluation, and visualization scripts
- ✅ Custom model architectures using PyTorch and Keras
- ✅ Practice notebooks for both beginner and intermediate-level concepts in DL

## 🛠️ Frameworks & Tools
- **PyTorch** – For building dynamic and flexible DL models
- **Keras (with TensorFlow backend)** – For quick prototyping and clean APIs
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For plotting and visualizing model performance
- **NumPy / Pandas** – For data manipulation and preprocessing
